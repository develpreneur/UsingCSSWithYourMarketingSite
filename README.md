# UsingCSSWithYourMarketingSite
This code compendium goes with the "Using CSS to Improve Your Marketing Site" section
of our "Launching an Internet Business"
(https://it4recruiters.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/developer-bootcamp). 

Class Description:
This course will teach students how to identify, create, and customize the look and 
feel of their company marketing sites using CSS.

Case Study:
This example continues building on our marketing site https://github.com/develpreneur/CreatingYourMarketingSit.  We have modified the initial HTML code  to include some CSS style. Each file uses a combination of in-line, internal and external CSS code for each page (index, about, contact).  There is also a style.css file that is included to show how users can build themes that can be applied across a web site.
